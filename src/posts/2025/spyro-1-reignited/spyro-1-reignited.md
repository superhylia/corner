After years of having it on the backlog and a recent binge of Spyro content for whatever reason (shoutout [EPG](https://www.youtube.com/c/ExoParadigmGamer)), I decided to finally take the plunge on one of the original PlayStation's classics and one of the most revered collect-a-thons ever.

While I usually start these reviews with the gameplay, I have to gush about the game's looks first and foremost. This game looks **incredible** and is easily one of the best-looking games I've ever played in my life. The colors are vibrant, the animations are so smooth, and the art direction is so evocative of a fantasy storybook while remaining loyal to the original 1998 game (which still looks great in my eyes). The graphics do come with some meh optimization on PC, with frames dropping into the high 50s, a texture streaming issue I needed to fix with a launch option, and the oddly bright lighting on shadow settings below High that look almost unintentional. Still, though, they absolutely nailed the Pixar look of these games, and it looks more breathtaking than in footage, especially at 60FPS. The soundtrack is also decent, though only a few tracks, like Lofty Castle, were personally very memorable. I've definitely heard better from future games, and I do wish *Reignited* did more with remixing the original soundtrack instead of something so similar to the original beyond a drumline added when charging.

This game is often seen as the weakest in its respective trilogy, but for my first rodeo in the series, I believe this is a really good foundation to stand on. A lot of the pitfalls in other platformers or collect-a-thons I've played are that there's a lot of retreading old ground: backtracking to prior areas to make significant progress, backtracking between areas with new abilities that don't drastically change gameplay, weak combat design, and in the worst cases, a tidal wave of alternate playstyles or minigames that distract from the core. In this case, *Spyro 1* does a great job sticking to its core of fast-paced platforming, rock-paper-scissors-esque combat, and rewarding exploration.

A weird, dead-zone octagonal movement issue aside, Spyro feels really good to control, and the Reignited animations make him feel reptilian and weighty in a way that feels good in the hand. Charging is challenging to master, but rewarding to string together when climbing stairs or moving quickly through large swaths of level, while being easy to transition into a glide or fire breath. The glide took a bit to get used to (especially since cancelling the glide is on a separate button and not a toggle/double-press), but eventually I overcame its quirks and found it worked well. Admittedly, there are a few very tight gliding sections, which makes me wish they could retrofit the Hover from future games into this first one. Given how fun it was, I also wish there were more Supercharge sections in levels and more utilization of the Superflame, which only get used for about seven and three stages each, respectively.

Combat design is some of the best I've seen in a platforming game personally, ingeniously making use of the charge and breath to make interesting enemy design that keeps you on your toes while being easy to understand. Spyro can only flame large enemies and can only charge metal enemies, which, when added with a modifier like jumping over the paintball shots or charging into barrels to destroy large enemy shields, creates a rock-paper-scissors style design that makes all enemy encounters challenging. Not only are they intrinsically rewarding to fight on their own merit, but enemies will also reward you with a Gem, which makes it actually valuable to defeat them all, and there was only one occasion where an enemy was the final Gem I needed to complete a stage. Sparx is both a genius way to communicate the player's health and a helpful companion: it's subtle, but you'll miss not having the Treasure Finder or automatically collecting nearby Gems when he's gone.

Speaking of Gems, the shining jewel of this game is the 20-some stages. Levels are designed exceptionally well, with gems doing an excellent job of dotting out the general path a player should take and being readable from a distance, making them a good source of intrigue and encouraging me to find alternate routes to collect them all. At an average length of about ~15 minutes or less, and fully completeable on a first go-through, levels have a good pace and mechanical escalation that make them memorable despite the somewhat repetitive theming by the game's end. Every stage has a notable setpiece, whether the Supercharge chain in Tree Tops or the glide in Haunted Towers near the back-end of the tower, making it exciting to collect all the Gems, Eggs, and Dragons and reach full completion. Skill Points add to this further for the stages that have them, even if they can be a bit obscure, though adding the Sparx Treasure Finder into this first game and a map makes full completion much easier to manage. 

Unfortunately, the topic of additions is where I find some negatives with the game and this remaster/remake in general. Beyond the Treasure Finder, Skill Points, and an optimized UI, the game and its design are carried over verbatim from the original. While in the case of the core mechanics and level design, this is absolutely fine, unlike other rereleases, this game doesn't add much content beyond the mini-challenges provided by Skill Points for about half the game's catalogue of levels, nor does *Reignited* fix *Spyro the Dragon*'s two biggest issues: the bosses and gameplay variety.

The bosses aren't good, which, for platforming standards, is unfortunately pretty par for the course. Despite fantastic mechanical escalation and combination in the actual stages, the bosses themselves are no different from the Egg-carrying thieves, except Metalhead, the only boss to really ask much from the player, as you destroy the antennas through your charge or the projectiles he throws at you. The five worlds themselves are short enough that they didn't drag the game down, but this was an area *Reignited* severely missed out on improving by giving the bosses more engaging gameplay and making them more present within the conflict of the story. It's a platformer, and I'm not expecting much narratively. Still, I do wish there were more incentive and motivation from the plot to explain why Spyro needs to save the denizens of each world and why we're fighting Dr. Shemp, Blowhard, Metalhead, and Jacques.

Given that the bosses are boring and underdesigned, it doesn't aid the lack of gameplay variety. While other collect-a-thons or 3D platformers like a certain plumber or hedgehog's adventures around this time had minigames or alternative characters to spruce things up, beyond the flight stages, *Spyro 1* doesn't rock the boat at all gameplay-wise. The flight stages themselves took time to grow on me control-wise, but in and of themselves, they were decent challenges that forced me to find the best route to maximize full completion under strict time limits. However, there are only five of them (one per world), and Gnasty's world lacks one of its own, which means for the roughly 4-8 hours of the game's runtime, you only have about an hour of respite total from the platform-fight-collect, platform-fight-collect gameplay loop. It's very focused on a strong core experience. While that core is elegantly made, a lack of minigames or new content only makes the somewhat repetitive level theming more apparent. Gnasty's Loot is a fantastic showcase for what could've been, mixing the aspects of the flight and regular stages for a vertical climb that tests all your skills: that sort of design injected into the bosses, or maybe even new bite-sized challenge stages that really honed in on that kind of design would've been worthwhile additions for a remake.

Despite its flaws, this game is still a blast to play and will go down as one of my favorite games for the original PlayStation and 3D platformers in general. One of the best-looking games I've ever seen, a fantastic core gameplay loop, accessible full completion of elegantly crafted stages, and a short run-time vastly outweigh the hitches holding it down.
