# What next?

Next time I update, I’ll have at least *something* to show in PICO-8 now that I have this mostly fleshed out. I still got to transfer from paper to Notion, but I have a very strong idea of how *Skiptrace* will play and progress. This has been fun to think about and draw up and I’m glad I get to make a game while you lovely folks get to read about it!

Until then, see you next post!
[^1]: *Fusion* is fantastic front to back, holy shit y’all gotta tap in
[^2]: *skiptrace*: to locate a missing person’s whereabouts, typically in regards to private investigation or bounty hunting.
