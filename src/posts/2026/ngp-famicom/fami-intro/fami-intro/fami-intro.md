## Foreword 
I have a bit of a problem. Growing up in the early 2010s, right at the turning point between the death of the message boards and the rise of the same few creative, now corporate, social media sites we do now was an interesting time to become a fan of games. Long-form content through fandom-specific wikis and the early era of YouTube Let's Plays and essays kept me entertained for hours. My entertainment turned to fascination and fascination turned to a passion for video games as a medium. This passion became a dream to make art of my own and it drives everything I create, learn, and at least attempt to learn. For the past two years or so, I've been self-studying game design while persuing computer science as my major, trying to figure out what makes games tick. Why are they fun? What makes a game engaging? What's the difference between "boring" and "bad", "difficult" and "challenging", a win condition to master or a piece of artistry a player gets to behold? Some days, though, there's a pull to question these things, perhaps the same pull that tugs at the other end of history, its tension keeping the rope taut throughout the years; how did we get here? Other days I ask: does it matter whats at the other end of the rope?

Amongst my friends I have a pretty infamously long backlog, a self-admitted inhibitor spurred by my own drive for games. Evenloping my desires and surrounding by guilt for stones left unturned is the undercurrent that flows between them: a want, no, a *need* to understand better. Missing out on *Silent Hill 2* (2001) or any of FromSoftware's works feels...contradictory, like a hollow in my armor as I set off to war for the artisty and preservation of thhe medium. I did say I have a bit of a problem, but hey, being aware of it is the first step, right? Many titles have the influence with the force of a magnetic pull and a reputation as glowing as the sun itself; these are our giants, the classics we view as statues.

With the onset of the *Virtual Console* for the Wii in 2006, the average consumer had the ability to play a variety of older titles on the NES and beyond and with the Wii's monumenetal successor, "average" consumer really did mean average. While the emulated Classic NES Series/Famicom Mini[^1] re-releases on the Game Boy Advance aimed for collectors with a decent, albeit compromised, experience, gamers who experienced these titles when they were younger and more presciently, new players who had never experienced them were able to re-discover prior generations for the first time. It's been cited that the turn of the millenium with the sixth generation introduced gaming to the mainstream through mature landmark titles like *Grand Theft Auto* that came out just as those who grew up with the first Nintendo were old enough to want those experiences. I believe the *Virtual Console* did the same for vintage games in our culture, bearing fruit as the 8-bit "glory days" became a shorthand for gaming as a whole and retro revival sequels to long-lost franchises like *Mega Man*, *Sonic the Hedgehog*, or *Pac-Man* arose because the audience for these games existed now in a way they hadn't before. 

But time changes all. We grow frail and light as we age, but the burden of keeipng us alive and present in those who care for us only grows more heavy. As golden age or as stone-cold as they may be, a "classic" (whatever that truly entails) can have the placard telling you of its intentions, maybe even its reception, but the cracks in any statue are in the eyes of the audience. The erosion of the foundation, the loss of shine in the glint of light, the chipping of the paint; if we slate these imperfections, who do we blame for them? The statue itself? Its architect? Wherever the liability holds, when these deformities become themselves? Were they always there or maybe always destined to be? 

They're old. The statues are "old". The Family Computer is coming up on 43 years since its release in 1983. NES games are as middle-aged as the plumber who revolutionized the pixels and polygons we call "video games." Their prime belongs to the past, clinging on to a time that doesn't serve them anymore: with so many re-releases and tugging of heart-strings, perhaps repetitively so. Games, like any art form, are subjective. One mans trash is another's treasure, but is time what decides the difference between the two men or how the "trash" is "treasured" amongst ourselves? People from around the world visit these games because we know them to be "classics", or at least know to *perceive* them as such. Some of the games in this museum of interactivity are preserved in prestine conditions, while others are not and still more lose their luster; where does the fault in our stars lie? Thousands of kilometers away from each other, does the fault move in ourselves or relative to us? If time erodes all, why go back? We've beared witness to many successors and contemporary games that evolved from this era; if we live in the now, should we still see beyond the crust the vintage is caked in? If we do, will the rocks silde? If its of value to challenge a foundation of an art, can we still know their earthquake of influence decades apart from their heyday as rock-solid phenomena?

Using all of these analogies for some 8-bit games made in the 80s may seem at odds with their percieved value in the present day. People haved moved on. The audience who made the endeavor to older, simpler times grew past the need for them and those who grew up with them became nostalgic for other things, placated by the many rereleases these games are lucky to have. Respected for their era, they lost their appeal: "unimpressive", "inaccessible", even "irrelevant" soon entered the vocabulary for describing these games. The statues of titans that built this industry were seen for what they really were: a fractured state of affairs. Very few show little imperfections while the remainder have been left to languish as newer reconstructions take their place. The wistfully written plaques they earned through retrospectives, reviews, and the testimonials who were "there" and "got it" rarely matched the image they were placed upon: was the praise imagination? Were they always like this? While the rise of emulation may have encouraged successors to take after these titles and emulate their aesthetic and gameplay, these too left the past behind, always rebuilding to follow the games of present to grant franchises a new future. 

I myself subscribed to this for a time. In some ways, I still do. I love and respect the history of this medium, but after so many attempts at antiques, I too wondered the value of many older games when their more polished, many times more acclaimed successors came around and supplanted them. Games like *Metroid* (1986) grew so sour that when I was growing up, its remake *Metroid: Zero Mission* (2004) had all but *replaced* it culturally. "Just play Zero Mission." "It replaces the original." "There's no point going back to it." It was something stronger than first-time recommendations, it became almost fact. For so many people, NES games weren't even options to begin with and for those who attempted them, not many made it to the other side to challenge this notion. It doesn't even have to be the NES in particular: the toleration for early 3D games wanes by the day and even the best of the GameCube, PlayStation 2, and Xbox are seen as "unplayable" today. We're at the point that remakes of 7th generation games, ones that were already in HD and for many of them, already decently accessible at least on PC, are not only more common, but demanded in many cases; *Demon's Souls*, *The Last of Us*, *Dead Space*, and likely *Resident Evil*'s outings during this era too. If games are art, how did retro games get perceived like this, as footnotes within the history that they themselves created? If a game that birthed the Metroidvania/search-action[^2] genre and perhaps the greatest game ever made with its third entry[^SM] is destined to be "replacable," is this what all games will become someday? 

As more and more of our culture relies on remakes or reboots or reinstallments of the same things of old, it makes me wonder why we revisit the past so often and so brazenly. A culture so hungry for our favorite meal, the meal we know, that anything new to the table can never and will never be filling enough. Like children knowing no better than the teat of their mother, nothing else placates us. There is always something to be milked, to be re-attempted, to be remade into perfection. At the cost of history's survival instincts comes convenience. Under the constant desire for reconstruction, the statues in the museum go on maintenance. As new techniques and the want to replicate them come about, we start from new again cheering from the lines outside the venue as the posters and promotions portray our precious. When we try to visit it in the meanwhile, it is never open to the pubilc because it is never good enough. A faximille of its plaque subdues us while we wait and wait for a game to be perfect, while the installation is too heavy to move to make anything new in that space.

Is this where our medium should be? If the answer is yes, have we gone far enough or limited ourselves by the need for a decade to pass to repair the installations of our history? Does how we engage with older games with a tongue of reproach and a tone of retreat warrant shedding the pounds holding them down in what we view as greatness? But if the answer is no to you, are we headed to that future already? If we value the old statues as they stood for the bright-eyed visitors when they were new even if they stagnate and shift with age when viewed today, do those same discussions all but guarantee that end? 

This isn't an essay series about remakes per se, but their implication and value to us depends on the titles they portray themselves as. It's an endeavor on how I engage with video games, the art that I adore, at its earliest, its most limited, and perhaps, its most foundational with the Nintendo Entertainment System and its library. Whether games can be supplanted so easily to the point of replacement by remakes or whether the conversations on these titles are marred by stigma or rejection when these experiences are proposed to curious eyes is "fair" to them; if games are an artform, these questions need answers or at least attempts to do so. What started as a want to revisit Link's and Samus' earliest adventure for a series marathon grew into something far larger, as I'm wont to do. A *Castlevania* game or two made themselves comfortable on the list. My negative experiences with *Mega Man 3* made its successor a scratch I had to itch, if nothing else but to see if 3's quality was just a fluke or a damnation of the series. Experiences I'd never experienced before like *Dragon Quest* or *Sweet Home* enticed me: I have a problem after all. Why not justify it so the drink goes down easier? 

> Through a curation of 30 of the Famicom's most fascinating comes a contrasting in what set apart "playing with power" from playing in arcades and earlier generation consoles during the system's infancy, a paratextual lens at the technical limitations that birthed and restrained some of its most influential titles, a chiseling of the conflation between difficulty and challenge that serves as the foundation of the game design passion I pursue, and finding my own words on the most acclaimed of the system's offerings if they defy the stigmatized question many hold: ==is there any value in taking a new gaze at Nintendo's Entertainment System today or do its games crumble under the weight of their age?==

Why isn't R.O.B featured? As a pretty big part of the North American launch of the system, being cited as the reason retailers and families alike bought into the NES, covering Robotic Operating Buddy was unfortunately not really feasible for my current circumstances. It being reliant on physical optical flashes from a CRT, the same technology that allows the Zapper to work, makes it impossible to emulate without a real toy or a CRT which isn't something I'm able to do. I do plan to cover the Zapper and other launch accessories for the NES during the *Duck Hunt* discussion, including R.O.B from a historical angle, but I don't feel comfortable discussing the experience of using one if I don't have it to test. 

[^1]: Not to be confused with the [*Nintendo Classic Mini: Family Computer* (the Japanese equivalent of the NES Classic Edition) mini console](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NES_Classic_Edition), or by that matter, the ["Classics Series" of budget game re-releases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_Series_(NES)) that served as the NES' equivalent to Player's Choice or Nintendo Selects. Mind you, this is the company that gave us *Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3*: naming isn't particularly their strong suit.
[^2]: By my own definitions, search-action games (used in Japanese promotion of games like *Metroid Dread* or *Touhou Luna Nights* to describe "Metroidvanias") are games that feature **interconnected maps with gated progression**, with Metroidvanias being a *sub-genre* that **gates progression specifically by unlockable abilities found by exploring**. This distinction will be covered more in the discussion of *Metroid*, *Sweet Home*, and *Castlevania II: Simon's Quest*, during this series and is probably worth a whole other essay on its own to discuss why there's a separation, but that's the gist.
[^SM]: *Super Metroid*. (1994)
[^DKOE]: A limited release 2010 version of the NES port made to celebrate the 25th anniversary of *Super Mario Bros.*. It features restored animation 50m or the "cement factory" stage the original port cut due to storage limitations for closer arcade accuracy. Both versions of the game will be discussed.
[^FDC]: Unfortunately, as the Famicom Disk System version of *Part I: The Missing Heir* and *Part II: The Girl Who Stands Behind* are yet to receive a fan translation, my only recourse was either the recent Switch remake of both games or the Super Famicom remake of *The Girl Who Stands Behind*, which is the version I have chosen to discuss. I'll do what I can to compare and contrast with what I can find on the original and the Super Famicom version has a well-lauded translation and a reputation for accuracy to the aesthetic and music of the FDS game.
