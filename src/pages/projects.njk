  Honestly, I made this starter for myself, based on how I want to start a project and how I like to organize
  everything. I am delighted that so many of you find it useful too! This is a list of sites based on / built
  with Eleventy Excellent. This uses Eleventy's
  <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/docs/services/screenshots/">screenshot API </a>. New screenshots are fetched
  in development only.
</p>

<p>
  Have you built a site with this starter? Please let me know or create a
  <a
    href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request"
    rel="noopener"
    >pull request</a
  >
  and add it to the list! Add your data in <code>src/_data/builtwith.json</code>, then run
  <code>npm run screenshots</code> to add or update the screenshots.
